# AtlantisWater
A map-based water distribution and logistics web-app. Features multi-destination route steps and navigation. Submitted for Hack3 2022 (Social Good app).

The program can be simply run through the index.html file and if needed with a replaced api token. More details for the website can be found at https://devpost.com/software/atlantis-water-distribution-app.

Our inspiration, app features, how we built the web app, technology used, and challenges we faced are discussed in my DevPost:
