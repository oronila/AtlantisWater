# AtlantisWater
A map-based water distribution and logistics web-app. Features multi-destination route steps and navigation. Submitted for Hack3 2022 (Social Good app).

The program can be simply run through the index.html file and if needed with a replaced api token. More details for the website can be found at https://devpost.com/software/atlantis-water-distribution-app.

Our inspiration, app features, how we built the web app, technology used, and challenges we faced are discussed in my DevPost:

## Inspiration
We noticed that water was a major 3rd world problem that still occurs today, so we took that inspiration from many accounts to make an app to guide people in need of water.

## What it does
- Website front-end established with a view of the global map
- Search bar integrated
- Route-outline Stepwise Logistics UI
- A request marker is placed on request button press
- Sequential marker requests will establish route between the previous marker and new marker
- Cluster a collection of markers on the map

## How We built it
We used APIs like google maps api to give us features to show visuals of locations that included water while also showing locations that needed water. It was created on a website so it also required HTML and Javascript to implement the features that we wanted to included.
## Challenges I ran into
We ran into issues like directions api which required money to use along with issues for cluttering stacked locations. There was also problems with the drawing of lines to give the best route to locations.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud of the structure that we built as it creates a strong framework to work off of for the rest of the app. It includes the use of maps api which prior to the competition we were unaware of on how to use.
## What I learned
I learned about maps api and its uses in the Javascript. We also learned the large selection of features within the maps api.
## What's next for Atlantis Water Distribution App
The next steps are quite large but can be done in due time. This includes adding a database with storage of locations and creating two views. The two separated views would be a view for people to request and get locations of areas with water and the other view would be from the distributors of water which can look for people in need of water to spread toward.
